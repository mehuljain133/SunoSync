## 🔄 Updating SunoSync

### If you built from source (Git):
1.  Open your terminal in the `SunoSync-main` folder.
2.  Run `git pull` to get the latest code.
3.  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to check for new dependencies.
4.  Run `python main.py` or rebuild the EXE.

### If you use the standalone EXE:

2.  Replace your old `SunoSync.exe` with the new one.

## �🔒 Transparency

We believe in 100% transparency. SunoSync is an indie tool built with Python.
*   **Crash Shield**: Built-in error reporting (Sentry) helps us fix bugs faster.
*   **False Positives**: Some antivirus software may flag the app because it is not digitally signed by a corporation. This is normal for open-source Python tools.
